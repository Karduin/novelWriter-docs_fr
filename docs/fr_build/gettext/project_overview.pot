If you try to open a project which already has such a file present, you will be presented with a warning, and some information about where else novelWriter thinks the project is also open. You will be given the option to ignore this warning, and continue opening the project at your own risk."

msgid "If you choose to ignore the warning and continue opening the project, and multiple instances of the project are in fact open, you are likely to cause inconsistencies and create diverging project files, potentially resulting in loss of data and orphaned files.
