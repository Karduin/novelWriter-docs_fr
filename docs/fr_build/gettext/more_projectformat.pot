#: ../../source/more_projectformat.rst:45
msgid "This is a modification of the 1.4 format. It makes the XML more consistent in that meta data have been moved to their respective section nodes as attributes, and key/value settings now have a consistent format. Logical flags are saved as yes/no instead of Python True/False, and the main heading of the document is now saved to the item rather than in the index. The conversion is done automatically the first time a project is loaded. No user action is required."
