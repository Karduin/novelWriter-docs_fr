msgid "In novelWriter there are no forms or tables to fill in to define characters, locations or other elements of your story. Instead, you create :term:`project notes` which you can mark as representing these story elements by creating a :term:`tag`. Whenever you want to link a piece of your story to a note defining a story element, like a character, you create a :term:`reference` back to that tag. You can also cross-link your project notes in the same way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:13
msgid "This is perhaps one of the features that makes novelWriter different from other, similar applications. It is therefore not always obvious to new users how this is supposed to work, so this chapter hopes to explain in more detail how to use this tags and references system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:18
msgid "If you find the Tags and Reference system difficult to follow just from reading this chapter, you can create a new project in the **Welcome** dialog's New project form and select  \"Create an example project\" from the \"Pre-fill project\" option. The example project contains several examples of tags and references."

msgid "Metadata in novelWriter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:29
msgid "The structure of your novelWriter project is inferred from the :term:`headings` within the documents, not the documents themselves. See :ref:`a_struct_heads` for more details. Therefore, metadata is also associated with headings, and not the documents directly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:33
msgid "If you split your project into separate documents for each scene, this distinction may not matter. However, there are several benefits to using documents at a larger structural scale when first starting your project. For instance, it may make more sense to define all your scenes, and even chapters, in a single document at first, or perhaps a document per act. You can later split these documents up using the document split feature. See :ref:`a_ui_tree_split_merge` for more details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:39
msgid "You can do the same with your notes. You can treat each heading as an independent element of your notes that can be referenced somewhere else. That way you can collect all your minor or background characters in a single note file, and still be able to reference them individually by separating them with headings and assigning each a tag."

msgid "How to Use Tags"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:50
msgid "A \"tag\" in novelWriter is a word or phrase that you define as belonging to a heading. Tags are set by using the ``@tag`` :term:`keyword`."
msgstr ""

msgid "``displayName`` (Optional)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:62
msgid "This is an optional display name used for the tag. When you build your manuscript, you can for instance insert the point of view character name directly into chapter headings. By default, the ``tagName`` value is used in such headings, but if you use a shortened format internally in your project, you can use this to specify a more suitable format for your manuscript headings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:67
msgid "You can only set **one** tag per heading, and the tag has to be unique across **all** documents in the project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:70
msgid "After a tag has been defined, it can be referenced in novel documents, or cross-referenced in other notes. Tags will also show up in the **Outline View** and in the references panel under the document viewer when a document is open in the viewer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:74
msgid "The syntax highlighter will indicate to you that the keyword is correctly used and that the tag is allowed, that is, the tag is unique. Duplicate tags should be detected as long as the index is up to date. An invalid tag should have a green wiggly line under it, and will not receive the colour that valid tags do."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/project_references.rst:79
msgid "The tag is the only part of these notes that novelWriter uses. The rest of the document content is there for you to use in whatever way you wish. Of course, the content of the documents can be added to the manuscript, or an outline document. If you want to compile a single document of all your notes, you can do this from the **Manuscript Build** tool."

It will also show up in the Character tab in the Reference panel below the document viewer, and in the reference auto-completer menu in the editor when you fill in references.
