msgid "You can drag and drop documents and regular folders, but not root folders. If you select multiple items, they can only be dragged and dropped if they are siblings. That is, they have the same parent item in the project. This limitation is due to the way drag and drop is implemented in the user interface framework novelWriter is built upon."

Notes can be moved freely between all root folders, but keep in mind that if you move a note into a **Novel** type root folder, its \"Importance\" setting will be switched with a \"Status\" setting. See :ref:`a_ui_tree_status`. The old value will not be overwritten though, and should be restored if you move it back at some point."

msgstr ""

msgid "You cannot reorganise the entries in the novel view, or add any new documents, as that would imply restructuring the content of the document files themselves.
