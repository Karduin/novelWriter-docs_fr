msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:21
msgid "You can also install novelWriter from the Python Package Index (PyPi_). See :ref:`a_started_pip`. Installing from PyPi does not set up icon launchers, so you will either have to do this yourself, or start novelWriter from the command line."

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:25
msgid "Spell checking in novelWriter is provided by a third party library called Enchant_. Generally, it should pull dictionaries from your operating system automatically. However, on Windows they must be installed manually. See :ref:`a_custom_dict` for more details."

msgid "Installing on Windows"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:35
msgid "You can install novelWriter with both Python and library dependencies embedded using the Windows Installer (setup.exe) file from the `Downloads page`_, or from the Releases_ page on GitHub_. Installing it should be straightforward."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:39
msgid "If you have any issues, try uninstalling the previous version and making a fresh install. If you already had a version installed via a different method, you should uninstall that first as having multiple installations has been known to cause problems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:44
msgid "The novelWriter installer is not signed because Microsoft doesn't currently provide a way for non-profit open source projects to properly sign their installers. The novelWriter project doesn't have the funding to pay for commercial software signing certificates. You will therefore see an additional warning about this when you download and run the installer."

msgid "Installing on Linux"

msgid "Debian and Mint"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:79
msgid "Since this is a pure Python package, the Launchpad PPA can in principle also be used on Debian or Mint. However, the above command will fail to add the signing key, as it is Ubuntu-specific."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_started.rst:117
msgid "novelWriter generally doesn't support Python versions that have reached end of life. If your Linux distro still uses older Python versions and novelWriter won't run, you may want to try the AppImage instead."
