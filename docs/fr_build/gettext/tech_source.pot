msgid "PyQt/Qt must be at least 5.15.0. If you want spell checking, you must install the ``PyEnchant`` package. The spell check library must be at least 3.0 to work with Windows. On Linux, 2.0 also works fine."

msgid "On Linux distros, the Qt library is usually split up into multiple packages. In some cases, secondary dependencies may not be installed automatically. For novelWriter, the library files for rendering the SVG icons may be left out and needs to be installed manually. This is the case on for instance Arch Linux."
