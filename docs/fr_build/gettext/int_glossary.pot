msgid "Each level of headings in :term:`Novel Documents` have a specific meaning in terms of the structure of the story. That is, they determine what novelWriter considers a partition, a chapter, a scene or a text section. For :term:`Project Notes`, the heading levels don't matter. For more details on headings in novel documents, see :ref:`a_struct_heads`."
