#: ../../source/more_customise.rst:37
msgid "A small tool to assist with this can be found under **Tools > Add Dictionaries**. It will import spell checking dictionaries from Free Office or Libre Office extensions. The dictionaries are then installed in the install location for the Enchant library and should thus work for any application that uses Enchant for spell checking."

#: ../../source/more_customise.rst:44
msgid "If you prefer to do this manually or want to use a different source than the ones mentioned above, You need to get compatible dictionary files for your language. You need two files files ending with ``.aff`` and ``.dic``. These files must then be copied to the following location:"

msgid "For novelWriter to be able to locate the custom theme files, you must copy them to the :ref:`a_locations_data` location in your home or user area. There should be a folder there named ``syntax`` for syntax themes, just ``themes`` for GUI themes, and ``icons`` for icon themes. These folders are created the first time you start novelWriter."
