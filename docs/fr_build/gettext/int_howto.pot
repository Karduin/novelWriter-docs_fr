This feature is most useful if you copy a project you have dedicated to be a template project. If you have a structure and settings you want to use for every new project, this is the best solution."

Then you can right click the folder, select :guilabel:`Transform` and :guilabel:`Merge Documents in Folder`."

msgid "In such cases you may want to use different scene headings for hard and soft scene breaks. The **Build Manuscript** tool will let you define a different format for scenes using the ``###`` and ``###!`` heading codes when you generate your manuscript. You can for instance add the common \"``* * *``\" for hard breaks and select to soft scene breaks, which will just insert an empty paragraph in their place.
